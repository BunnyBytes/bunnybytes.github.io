# Hello World! üêá 

I'm a software developer from the UK. My name on Github (and potentially other online platforms) and on here is BunnyBytes, but I also use the online moniker **Dizzy**. üå∏

The purpose of this website is to have a single place for my thoughts, projects, and other things I think are fun or cool!

It also functions as a place for those looking to work with me online to familiarise themselves with who I am and what I do. Although, to be safe, I'm going to avoid sharing details which will link my online profile to my real life identity.

## So, what do you do?

### Working

At the time of writing this, I work from home full-time as a software developer. I've worked as a software developer on-and-off since I graduated in 2020 with a degree in Computer Science. I mainly work with C# and my focus is on developing back-end applications, though I'm interested in working with front-end tech as well.

### Hobbies

I have a passion for attending metal festivals and concerts, but when I'm not out and about, I like to work on my own software projects (which we'll get into later!) and look after my pet snail Jellybean. üêå

While I don't do it competitively, I like to run to stay fit. 

I also dabble in some forms of art (3D modelling and drawing), but to be honest, **I'm a bit shit at it**. üí©

### Holy frick, you just dropped a swear word on a site recruiters and employers are going to see!

While I know there's a time and place to be professional, part of the reason for me creating this website is to be **unapologetically myself**.

As a nerdy, vegan, queer neurodivergent, and as someone who's been in various positions in the software development industry, I've found that it's important to embrace the parts of you that make you unique.

I won't go into detail about what I mean by that in this post, as it's a bit heavy for an intro - but generally, I've found putting on a mask to fit into a corporate mould isn't a good angle. If I'm a square peg because I'm queer, or neurodivergent, or just fuckin' weird, then so be it - remember, I believe in being **unapologetically yourself**\* since at the end of the day, I get the job done. And that's what matters.

\*Unless you're an asshole.

In the words of **Tyrion Lannister** - *"Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armour, and it can never be used to hurt you."*

## Identity
I am a pansexual transgender female metalhead with ADHD, combined type. I go by she/her. I'm also a bit of a furry, kinda.

I started my transition in November of 2021, and I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2024. It's been an insane journey, which I will talk about in another post!

I meant it when I said I was being **unapologetically myself** in this post.

I make a point by bringing up being a metalhead as well, since so much of my activities, interests, and social life revolve around that particular interest. I suppose the same applies to my passion as a programmer!

## What can I expect going forward?

Lots of content where I talk about what's on my mind, what I'm working on, and other cool stuff in my life - like Jellybean!

I might also add some guidance for people navigating their ADHD or gender dysphoria, among other things I feel qualified to talk about.

Okay bye
